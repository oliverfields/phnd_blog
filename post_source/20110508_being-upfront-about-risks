Title: Being upfront about risks
Description: Fixed price contracts must sufficiently detail the assumptions that they are based on. Having been upfront about these risks with the client is vital in the event of cost increases.

If a web project is not sufficiently defined then scope creep can a big risk. If a fixed price contract has also been signed the agency is probably being overly optimistic.

To avid working for free it seems to be vital that the contract is clear about what assumptions have been made. If these assumptions would be modified then that should  be reflected in the final project price. Paramount to getting acceptance for increased costs is that the client has been prepared for this.

Being upfront about the project assumptions and their potential to increase project cost requires that those sealing the deal with the client are knowledgeable about what these assumptions have been and that they are honest about the risks. If they are not, the client will expect the project to be delivered as agreed and will be more hesitant to cost increases.

Past experience, sufficient level of project estimation and clear project methodology are important to give confidence when explaining to the client that the project may turn out different than planned. As with many things project management, the key is communicating and making sure people understand what is going on.
