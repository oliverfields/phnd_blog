**Q.** What can everyone have an opinion about? **A.** Website design

Clients will humor meetings about technical aspects of a site, and many will participate actively in SEO questions, but what gets them really fired up is when  design is being discussed.

Too gray, move that over there, can we have a border here. Presenting a website design means anyone can suddenly have an opinion because design opinions are prone to subjectivity. Whilst functionality either works or doesn't, checking design tasks as done is more subjective.


h2 Design revisions

In order to limit time spent discussing designs a good practice is to add design revisions to the development process. Basically a design revision is a set of changes the client has asked for that are then implemented. This is best explained with an example. A given agency creates the initial design and sends to client. The client asks for 3 changes and the agency implements the changes into a new design. Implementing client changes is one revision.

Allowing a set number of revisions allows the agency to more predictably estimate a project and provides a nice way to tell a client that ‘Sorry, we have done all are revisions, we can do more but that will be billed separately.’ (obviously assuming the revisions process was mentioned up front). Personally a limit of 2 revisions per project seems to be ok, but many use 3.


h2 Tracking revisions

When operating with revisions it becomes important to let the client know what revision they are at and to keep track of which files are the latest. A file naming convention is helpful for this, for instance **[client]-[project]-[page type]-r[x].[file extension]**. E.g. **Acme-SiteRedesign-Frontpage-r2.psd**. This makes it easy to see what revision a given design is.


Design revisions is a useful way of adding a safety valve to a project, because it upfront allows a set number of hours to be allocated to design, focuses the client on staying within their allocated revisions and allows billing of any extra work that may be generated by executives who flip flop between yellow and green for the &lt;h1&gt; titles.
